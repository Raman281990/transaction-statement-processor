# transaction-statement-processor
This Application processes the transaction statements and generates report of failed records

Rabobank receives monthly deliveries of customer statement records. This information is delivered in two formats, CSV and XML. These records need to be validated.

## Input
The format of the file is a simplified version of the MT940 format. The format is as follows:

Table 1. Record description
Field	Description

Transaction reference A numeric value

Account number

An IBAN

Start Balance The starting balance in Euros

Mutation Either an addition (+) or a deduction (-)

Description

Free text

End Balance The end balance in Euros

## Output:

There are two validations:

all transaction references should be unique

the end balance needs to be validated

At the end of the processing, a report needs to be created which will display both the transaction reference and description of each of the failed records.

## Technologies Used

1) Java8
2) Spring boot
3) Spring batch
4) Mysql
5) Docker

 and saves the inValid records in the Job Execution Context.
 
 Once the Batch completes, then CSV data is generated for the failed records.
 
 Valid Records are saved in TransactionStatement table.
 
 ## Batch Reader: reades the records from XML file.
 
 ## Validator Processor: validates the records based on validation and save the failed records in JobExceutionContext.
 
 ## Batch Writer: writes the valid records to the database
